# CheatSTB
Overview:
CheatSTB is a mobile application that replicates approximately 90% of the official Bucharest Transport Company (STB) app. It was created as a personal project aimed at bypassing fare inspectors on buses and trams.

## Project Details:
The app includes several key features from the original STB app, such as:

-Home page
-User profile page
-Ticket purchase options
-Ticket types (Note: the QR code is a joke, is not appropriate for actual use, it might contain 18+ content)
